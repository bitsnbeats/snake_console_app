This game runs and displays the classic game Snake on the command-line.

I wrote this game in my journey to learn C++. Most of the code is original, but I took
the concepts for how to build snake from javidx9 and I copied few lines of code 
(also from javidx9) that created a handle to the console and managed input timing.
Javidx9 has a fantastic Youtube channel where he teaches various console C++ projects.
You can check him out with this link:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA

If you are interested in just playing Snake and not the code behind it, please download
the Snake zip file. Inside is a .exe file that will run snake in your console. Before
running it however, please read the README file within the zip file. It contains instructions
for changing your console's display size. This is necessary for Snake to display
properly. Unfortunately, I do not know how to change the console display size explicitly with
code yet, perhaps in the future I may update this project.

If you encounter any bugs, or have any feedback, please let me know! I am always looking
to learn more and how to write better and more efficient code. You can post your comments
in the Issues tab.

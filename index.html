    <h1> My Website: Draft 1</h1> <br>
    
    <p>
        Hello World!
    </p>

    <img src = "Logo.png" alt = "My logo should display here" width = 100>

    <p> Just a website where I'm trying out things for now. <br>
         Eventually, I would like to do the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> Put up my resume</li>
        <li> Put up a brief bio</li>
        <li> Put up my portfolio, with links to my compiled projects and source code</li>
        <li> Put up links to my itch.io page ang Github page</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
         Here's a list of projects I want in my portfolio:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li> Command-Line RPG Battle Simulator (Completed)</li>
        <li> Command-Line Snake (Completed) </li>
        <li> Game Jam Deep Sea Diver (Completed)</li>
        <li> Game Jam GMTK (Uncompleted)</li>
        <li> Open GL Audio Visualizer (Uncompleted)</li>
        <li> Mobile Game Rocket Golf (Uncompleted)</li>
    </ol>

    <p> So it looks like you can write text in the body without paragraph tags. However, <br>
        paragraph tags automatically add space before and after the the text enclosed in <br>
        them. So it's a good idea to use them!
